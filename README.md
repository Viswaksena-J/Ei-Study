## Project Overview

This repository contains solutions for two exercises focusing on design patterns and a terminal-based Virtual Classroom Manager. The project was completed as part of an assignment to demonstrate code quality, adherence to best practices, and the implementation of software design patterns.

### 1. **Exercise 1: Design Patterns**
The first exercise demonstrates my understanding of software design patterns through six different use cases:
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Two use cases implemented.
- **Creational Patterns**: Two use cases implemented.
- **Structural Patterns**: Two use cases implemented.

Each pattern has been implemented with clean, modular code following global best practices. Key elements include logging, error handling, and validation. 

### 2. **Exercise 2: Virtual Classroom Manager**
The second exercise involves building a terminal-based Virtual Classroom Manager for an EdTech platform. The following features have been implemented:

- **Classroom Management**: Add, list, and remove classrooms.
- **Student Management**: Enroll students in classrooms and list them.
- **Assignment Management**: Schedule assignments for classrooms and allow students to submit them.

The focus of this exercise was on logic, code quality, and adherence to SOLID principles. The solution leverages appropriate design patterns, optimized for performance, and includes mechanisms for exception handling and logging.
